# Week 1: Introduction and Setup

This week's exercises are to ensure that you are able to access the course content, resources and systems.  You will need to sign in to the HPC system, check that you can run a series of commands, and execute some test code.

The program `proof.c` is used with the instructions on Loop under "Demonstrate access to systems".  It is not necessary (yet) that you understand how it works. If you want to read ahead and try to work it out, however, that would be a valuable exercise

The program `hello_world.c` is used with the "C Programming Primer" which should be available under "Additional Resources."
